(AP: 5, 5, 5, 5, 9) In March of 2043, space agencies including NASA and other space agencies
  will each give volunteers and some money to fund and create the Intergalactic
  Travel Agency (ITA). The ITA will only supervise projects like the Athena
  Mission which are missions to explore undiscovered areas of the galaxy. They
  will do this because if any specific country takes control of the Athena
  Mission, they may be selfish and block other countries out and not allowing
  them to take part of the new area.
    The ITA will be people from all different countries taking part in this
  agency so that control will not be an issue. People that support this will be
  all major countries' citizens. People that oppose this are the other countries
  that want the planet for themselves. Benefits of this plan are that funding is
  not an issue, everyone who contributes to the ITA will have land on the newly
  discovered planet.
    The ITA will be created by any countries who want to be apart of the new
  planet and who are willing to volunteer members of their space agencies. The
  ITA will be created so there is no argument on which countries have power in a
  certain area. The ITA will replace the SDS in the Athena mission so that there
  is no questioning of control.
