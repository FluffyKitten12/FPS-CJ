The ITA will only supervise projects like the Athena Mission which are missions to explore undiscovered areas of the galaxy. They will do this because if any specific country takes control of the Athena Mission, they may be selfish and block other countries out and not allowing them to take part of the new area.\n The ITA will be people from all different countries taking part in this agency so that control will not be an issue. People that support this will be all major countries' citizens. People that oppose this are the other countries that want the planet for themselves. Benefits of this plan are that funding is not an issue, everyone who contributes to the ITA will have land on the newly discovered planet.\n The ITA will be created by any countries who want to be apart of the new planet and who are willing to volunteer members of their space agencies. The ITA will be created so there is no argument on which countries have power in a certain area. The ITA will replace the SDS in the Athena mission so that there is no questioning of control."
