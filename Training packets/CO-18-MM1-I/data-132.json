You will have your own profile, and you can get rewards for reporting crimes. When you link your personal technology to the system, the rewards will go straight to your account. THe more crimes you report, the safer the community will be. To prove that you have reported a crime, you can hook your personal technology to the system. An obstacle with this system would be peole trying to lie about the number of crimes they've reported. As mentioned earlier though, the evidence will come from personal technology being hooked up to the record system.\n There will be some assistance and resistance for this solution. THe forms of assistance would be from citizens who have experienced a crime. They would help by funding the program. Another form of assistance would be peole who are against crime. They will help the SSI in Georgetown create and fund the record system. One form of resistance would be citizens who don't want to cooperate with the police. To get past this form of resistance, we can convince them that this system will help keep crime rates at bay and keep their community safe. This saves the Underlying Problem becuase if more crimes are reported using the record system, less criminal activity would take place. Also citizens will most likely want to report crimes for the rewards.\n Besides solving the underlying problem, this solution can save other problems. If the SSI adds more uses to this system, one of them could be a place to store medical records. This would make it easier for people working in the medical field to view the records of their patients, because they just need to use the system. Also, becuase everyone has a profile, the police could view this and use it as a way to identify suspects of a crime"
