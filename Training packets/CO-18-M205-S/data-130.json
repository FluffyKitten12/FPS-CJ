This program is a satellite system which will store data across 100 satellites with Quantum Computing/Storing devices. These devices communicate with each other very similarly to the Cloud to store store information.\n Quantum Computers were first developed around 2020 by the company D-wave. Instead of normal transistors, a quantum computer uses atoms and \"mixed\" polarities for bits. Quantum computers use bits called qubits with infinite positions called superpositions. The difficulty with Quantum Computers was their bits would change value when measured. This phenomenon was mastered with other Quantum Physics phenomenon in 2032 which has made it possible to use there machines.\n This satellite system will be called the Quantum Storing and Secure Satellite System or the Q4S. The reason that these computers are faster is that qubits compute exponentially faster than normal computers, thus making them faster, more secure, and smaller. Because the Q4S does have Quantum computers and those computers work almost at absolute zero degrees, they are a satellite system instead of a data warehouse on Earth.\n People who support the Q4S are consumers and non-Cloud companies who keep information on the Cloud. Other Cloud companies want to stay separate of the Q4S. We can solve this by updating their systems with more expensive quantum computers with cooling systems that can be on earth.\n The Q4S is a lot better way of storing consumers information because it is faster, smaller, and more secure than normal computers. The Q4S will keep the Cloud the best way of storing information and work."
