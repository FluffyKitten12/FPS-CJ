The ITPA will be created because identity theft victims have nowhere to report their cases.\n The jobs of the ITPA are as followed: 1. To have identity victims report to them. 2. To use an algorithm that tries to find identity thieves of reported victims. 3. To supervise businesses that keep personal information.\n They will do these tasks because no other agencies take care of these problems. The people that will be for this change are the victims of ID theft. The ones who will not like this are hackers.\n The ITPA is a brilliant agency that will benefit everybody of the world because they can take over the ID theft that the FBI does and they can take it into their own hands because the agents of the ITPA are experts on ID theft and they know how to help people when they need it"
