### FPS Packet Analytics

## General description

Making an analytical program to judge Future Problem Solvers competition packets. A neural networks might be added in future but the goal of this program is to 'judge' or grade a packet.
  Where a judge would check if you have a stem in your UP, for example. A computer can check that as well.

#_catagory.py_
  This file takes the input of a folder in the root directory called Packet and outputs data associated with each problem, solution, the UP, etc.

#_main.py
  The main file is going to be the file where it takes the arrays and dictionaries from catagory.py and scores the Packet. Main.py possibly may tell the user what they did well on and what they need to improve on.
